    <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>

    <img src="../images/macandcheese.jpg">

    <p>This homemade mac and cheese recipe uses a classic mixture of sharp Cheddar and Parmesan. 
        Cheddar is a fantastic base, while Parmesan adds a more complex and salty flavor. 
        Of course, you can adapt this recipe to suit your taste: Gruyere, Monterey Jack, 
        and Gouda are all great options for macaroni and cheese.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>

        <li>¼ cup salted butter</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed</li>

        <li>½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>

    <h3>Bread Crumb Topping</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>

        <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>

        <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <strong><ol>
        <li><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</p></li>

        <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add macaroni and simmer, it will finish cooking in the oven. 
            Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</p></li>

        <li><p>While the macaroni is cooking, melt ¼ cup butter 
            in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir 
            until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 
            3 to 5 minutes</p></li>

        <li><p>Gradually whisk 2 ½ cups milk into the flour mixture,
            and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated
            Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over
            low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes,
            adding up to ½ cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni
            and stir until well combined.</p></li>

        <li><p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat.
            Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread
            bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinke with paprika.</p></li>

        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown
                and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</p></li>
